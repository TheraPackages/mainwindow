## Template-project

This is a simple project for startup. For simplicity, we present a single file project accompany with several configuration files.

```
.
├── .thera
│   └── launch.json   # project configuration
├── mock
│   └── config.json   # mock configuration
│   └── mock_file_1.json   # mock data files
│   └── mock_file_2.json
├── main.vue          # project entry
├── package.json      # project dependencies
└── README.md         # project DOC
```
